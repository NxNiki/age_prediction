## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(MASS)

beta = c(1, 1, -.5)
x = rnorm(100, 0, 1)
x2 = x^2
X = t(rbind(rep(1,100), x, x2))
X1 = t(rbind(rep(1,100), x))
beta1 = c(1, 1)
#y = X %*% beta + rnorm(100, 0, .5)
y = X1 %*% beta1 + rnorm(100, 0, .5)


theta = ginv(t(X1) %*% X1) %*% t(X1) %*% y

yhat = X1 %*% theta

plot(x, y)
plot(y, yhat)
plot(y, yhat-y)
plot(yhat, yhat-y)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
